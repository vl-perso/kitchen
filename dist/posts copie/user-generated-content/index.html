Not all websites need a back-end, but what you get by adding this additional layer to the stack is the ability to store and manage user generated content.</p><p>If you want to add any kind of rich features to a static site and want to retain control of the platform, and ownership of data, Keystone is a good choice. It's open source and highly flexible in ways that third-party services can't provide.</p><p>To help add user generated content to static sites I built the <a href="https://github.com/MadeByMike/keystone-jamstack-plus">Keystone JAMstack Plus starter kit</a> for Keystone that ties in with Supermaya. It allows you to skip a lot of the overhead of deploying and hosting a CMS like WordPress or attempting to unify many different APIs in a build process. Keystone's package based architecture means you can build tiny streamlined CMS and API designed specifically for your content.</p><p>Don't need rich features? Although Supermaya has ties into Keystone it absolutely stands on it's own as a great static site template. It was not created for Keystone but it was created to make it a little easier to go beyond purely static content if you need.</p><p>If you've already deployed Supermaya you will need to add a <code>KEYSTONE_API</code> environmental variable to your front-end.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Rich features are optional. Supermaya is a perfectly good starter template for 11ty without any other services.</p></body></html>
